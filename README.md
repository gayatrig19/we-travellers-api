# We Travellers - API

This README is for the backend api of a full stack web application - We Travellers. This API provides a backend database (models and logic) to allow the frontend React application to perform CRUD operations.

   - Live API link goes here 
   - To view the api in a nicer format install a JSON extension like [this one](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jsonvue/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc)

# User Experience and Design

## The Strategy Plane

### Site Goals

"We Travellers" is a social media content sharing platform designed to bring together a vibrant community of travelers who love to share their experiences and discover new destinations. At We Travellers, every journey is a story waiting to be told. Whether it is a weekend getaway, an epic cross-country road trip, or an exotic international expedition, the platform allows users to share their travel experience through captivating posts, stunning photos and travel stories.

- The aim of the website is to provide a simple, intuitive, visually appealing and user-friendly platform where users can post / share their travel moments, interact with each other by following, commenting, bookmarking and liking posts and comments. The website caters to a diverse audience, from young adults to older generations with an interest in exploring new places, sharing their travel stories or someone who wants an inspiration for their next travel destinations.
- The application aims to provide a sleek and intuitive user interface, ensuring easy accessibility and seamless navigation across all features. Moreover, it is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.

- The features are presented in a way that makes it easy for users to find what they're looking for.

- Users can have access to complete features of the website with more personalized content when registered(logged-in). Users can sign in / sign-up to the website by filling out a simple form containing username and password. With logged-in status, users can create(add), update, retrieve and delete the travel posts. 
- Registered users can also like the posts and comments made by other community members. They can bookmark the travel posts they are interested in the most and save it to visit later. To interact with like-minded travelers and get involved with the community, users can create, retrieve, update or delete comments on posts. The follow / unfollow features allows users to access the posts by the users they are interested in as a separate feed.
- Logged-in users can update their profiles for username, password, their bio and profile avatar. For a personlized user experience, users can view their username and profile avatar in navigation bar through all pages.
- The posts are accessible to all the users regardless of their logged-in status. Users can also search for travel stories using search / filter functionality. Users can filter posts by title, profile username, region and place to easily find what they are looking for, making their experience smooth and enjoyable.
- The website navigation provides easy access to all website sections, including personalized content for logged in users.


### Agile Planning 

I employed the Agile methodology and utilized a GitHub project board to organize and develop my user stories starting from the project planning stage and continuing until the final product was built. To enhance clarity and structure, a user story template is designed that precisely outlines each user story with an acceptance criteria to be fulfilled. Small features have been assigned to 7 milestones.

- All User Stories include:
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Labels (MoSCoW Prioritization)

- Labels have been used to mark which features the project : 'must have', 'should have', 'could have' and 'nice to have'. The prioritization was done so that a MVP for the project is created in time I have and only focus on the 'should haves' or 'could haves' if the time allows.

- I have created two additional labels to indicate which stories required the backend work and which ones required the front-end work:    
    - **API-backend** - for backend api implementation
    - **React-frontend** - for frontend react app

- The user stories that have both labels is discussed in each README. Instead of creating separate 'developer stories' and 'user stories' for both API and React, I have incorporated both in a single workflow for more structured work with less chaos.

- Each User story was checked for the acceptance criteria have been met and closed.

- The detailed Project Board with all user stories can be found here. [PROJECT BOARD-link](https://github.com/gayatrig19/we-travellers-frontend/projects?query=is%3Aopen)

#### Milestones

- 1. Initial Project Setup:The first task in starting the project was to set it up. All the tasks from setting up github repository to installing django, setting up django app and related packages and libraries were included in this milestone. The acceptance criteria was refined for each of the setup to be completed for clarity and ease of understanding.

- 2. Navigation and Authentication: This milestone covers user authentication and authorization i.e. user sign-up, sign-in and signout so that user can explore complete features and functionality of the website.
- 3. Profiles: Allows users to Create, Retrieve and Edit (CRE) own details. Also allows other users to find out more about a user.
- 4. Posts: This milestone includes all the features enabling the CRUD functionality for the user. 
- 5. Comments: Includes all the features enabling the CRUD functionality for the user.
- 6. Like and Bookmark Posts: Allows users to like / unlike and bookmark posts. Users can perform create, retrieve and delete (CRD) functionality on liked and bookmarked posts.
- 7. Documentation and Deployment: This milestone was needed so that I can document my project in-depth with all website features, testing, deployment information. Deployment section is included as it was absolutely necessary and important to have a live link of fully functional website with no errors so that everyone can have access to the application.
